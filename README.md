# bbcWebsiteClone

This is a practice website to build the bbc.com website layout. Starting with breaking down the HTML syntax, styling the site with CSS & floats (for practice), and javascript for interactivity. 

This site is using the [normalize css style](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), a different approach to resets. I wanted to get practice using both the normalize styling and css resets to better understand the differences they cause when building websites.
